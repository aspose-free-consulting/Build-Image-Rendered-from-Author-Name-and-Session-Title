# Build Image Rendered from Author Name and Session Title
This free consulting project uses Aspose.Slides to create an image from text (author name and session title) so this information can later be shown on web or anywhere just as an image. 

You can also use and customize this code to achieve any of the following:

* Create an image from the text
* Create a PowerPoint slide from text
* Create presentation from text
