# Build Image Rendered from Author Name and Session Title
This [free consulting](https://aspose-free-consulting.github.io/) project domonstrates [creating an image from text using Aspose.Slides](https://products.aspose.com/slides) (author name and session title) so this information can later be shown on web or anywhere just as an image. 

You can also use and customize this code to achieve any of the following:

* Create an image from the text
* Create a PowerPoint slide from text
* [Create presentation from text](https://docs.aspose.com/display/slidesnet/Adding+and+Formatting+Text)
* [Convert PowerPoint slide to image](https://docs.aspose.com/display/slidesnet/Converting+Presentation+to+TIFF)

The above screenshot shows that the web page takes some text as input. We'll use this text to convert to an image. You can also convert this or any other text to a PowerPoint slide or presentation as well by adopting this code for your use case.

In the above screenshot, user clicks the Generate Image button, to convert the text to image. The code at the backend will take this text as input and then create an image from that.

The idea behind this is same but it can be used in a variety of scenarios. Aspose.Slides for .NET or Java can be used to [create PowerPoint slides and presentations](https://docs.aspose.com/display/slidesnet/Creating+and+Opening) as well as images in your code without requiring Microsoft PowerPoint. So you can use this code in any of your applications without requiring any extra tools or software.

Finally, the image is generated. We have kept it simple. But you can add more text and also format the text as you want. Aspose.Slides for .NET and Java provides quite a lot of flexiblity to convert text to images or slides. The API is simple and easy to use.
